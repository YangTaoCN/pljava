	/**
	 * Class that collects adjustment APIs for affecting the behavior of
	 * PL/Java's XML support.
	 *<h1>XML parser behavior adjustments</h1>
	 *<p>
	 * Retrieving or verifying the XML content in a JDBC {@code SQLXML} object
	 * can involve applying an XML parser. The full XML specification includes
	 * features that can require an XML parser to retrieve external resources or
	 * consume unexpected amounts of memory. The full feature support may be an
	 * asset in an environment where the XML content will always be from a
	 * known, trusted source, or a liability if less is known about the XML
	 * content being processed.
	 *<p>
	 * The <a
	 * href='https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_The_Open_Web_Application_Security_Project'
	 *>Open Web Application Security Project</a> (OWASP) advocates for the
	 * default use of settings that strictly limit the related features of Java
	 * XML parsers, as outlined in a
	 * <a
	 * href='https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#java'
	 *>"cheat sheet"</a> the organization publishes. The strict default settings
	 * can then be selectively relaxed in applications where the features are
	 * needed and the content is sufficiently trusted.
	 *<p>
	 * However, the recommended defaults really are severely restrictive (for
	 * example, disabling document-type declarations by default will cause
	 * PL/Java's {@code SQLXML} implementation to reject all XML values that
	 * contain DTDs). Therefore, there must be a simple and clear way for code
	 * to selectively adjust the settings, or adopting the strictest settings by
	 * default would pose an unacceptable burden to developers.
	 *<p>
	 * The usual way that Java XML parsers expose their settings for adjustment
	 * is through {@code setFeature} or {@code setProperty} methods that must be
	 * passed particular URIs that identify adjustable features, and objects of
	 * appropriate types (often boolean) as the values for those properties. The
	 * supported properties and the URIs that identify them can be different
	 * from one parser implementation to another or one version to another. That
	 * is not the "simple and clear" adjustment mechanism needed here.
	 * Furthermore, the JDBC {@code SQLXML} API conceals much of the complexity
	 * of configuring any underlying XML parser behind a simple
	 * {@code getSource} method whose result can be used directly with other
	 * Java APIs expecting some flavor of {@code Source} object, and for some of
	 * those flavors, the returned object does not even expose the methods one
	 * would need to call to adjust the underlying parser, if any.
	 *<p>
	 * Hence this adjustment API. JDBC already provides for extensibility of the
	 * {@code SQLXML.getSource} method; it is passed the class object for a
	 * desired subtype of {@code Source} and, if the implementation supports it,
	 * returns an object of that type. The subtypes that every conformant
	 * implementation must support are {@code StreamSource}, {@code SAXSource},
	 * {@code StAXSource}, and {@code DOMSource}. If {@code null} is passed, the
	 * implementation will choose which flavor to return, often based on
	 * internal implementation details making one most natural or efficient.
	 *<p>
	 * The types {@link SAXSource}, {@link StAXSource}, and {@link DOMSource}
	 * are used the same way, by passing the corresponding class literal to
	 * {@code SQLXML}'s {@code getSource} method, which will return an object
	 * providing the chainable adjustment methods of {@link Source}, with the
	 * chain ending in a {@link Source#get get} method that returns the
	 * corresponding Java {@code Source} object, configured as adjusted.
	 *<p>
	 * Example:
	 *<pre>
	 *SAXSource src1 = sqx1.getSource(SAXSource.class);
	 *SAXSource src2 = sqx2.getSource(Adjusting.XML.SAXSource.class)
	 *                     .allowDTD(true).get();
	 *</pre>
	 * {@code src1} would be assigned a {@code SAXSource} object configured with
	 * the OWASP-recommended defaults, which will not allow the content to have
	 * a DTD, among other restrictions, while {@code src2} would be assigned a
	 * {@code SAXSource} object configured with the other default restrictions
	 * (as if the {@code allowDTD(true)} is preceded by an implied
	 * {@link Source#defaults defaults()}), but with DTD parsing enabled.
	 *<p>
	 * No {@code Adjusting.XML.StreamSource} is needed or provided, as any
	 * application code that requests a {@code StreamSource} will have to
	 * provide and configure its own parser anyway.
	 *<p>
	 * Like passing {@code null} to {@code getSource}, passing the parent
	 * interface {@code Adjusting.XML.Source.class} will allow the
	 * implementation to choose which subtype of {@code Adjusting.XML.Source} to
	 * return. The object returned by {@link Source#get get} can then be passed
	 * directly to Java APIs like {@code Transformer} that accept several
	 * flavors of {@code Source}, or examined to see of what class it is.
